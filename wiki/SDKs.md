# CAP SDKs

The Cordum Agent Protocol (CAP) has official SDKs for several popular programming languages. These SDKs provide a convenient way to interact with the CAP bus and build CAP-enabled applications.

## Supported Languages

*   **[Go](./Go-SDK.md):** The Go SDK is the reference implementation and is the most feature-complete.
*   **[Python](./Python-SDK.md):** The Python SDK is ideal for AI/ML applications and scripting.
*   **[Node.js](./Node-js-SDK.md):** The Node.js SDK is suitable for building web-based applications and services that interact with the CAP bus.
*   **[C++](./C---SDK.md):** The C++ SDK is designed for high-performance applications where low-level control is required.

Each SDK provides helpers for:

*   Connecting to the NATS bus.
*   Creating and sending `BusPacket` messages.
*   Building workers that can process jobs.
*   Signing and verifying messages for security.
