# Cortex Agent Protocol - Specification Index

This folder contains the normative specification for the Cortex Agent Protocol (CAP). The protobuf definitions in `proto/` are the canonical wire format; the prose here defines semantics, expectations, and recommended behaviors.

## Conformance
- RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) are normative.
- Compatibility is append-only: existing fields are never renumbered or repurposed.
- Implementations are compliant when they honor message shapes, state machine rules, and safety hooks defined here.

## Versioning
- `protocol_version` in `BusPacket` is used for wire negotiation. Current wire version: `1` (schema 1.0.0).
- Protobuf evolution is append-only: add new fields with new numbers; do not delete or reuse.
- Repository/SDK releases track implementation bits (Go/Python/Node/C++); pin to tags (e.g., `v1.0.5`) for reproducibility.
- Protocol vs SDK:
  - Protocol wire schema: 1.0.0 (stable).
  - Repository/SDK: 1.0.x (may add helpers, docs, and generated stubs without wire breaks).
